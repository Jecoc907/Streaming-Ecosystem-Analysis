## Overview
This repository contains our Streaming Ecosystem Analysis, was conducted by Chun Yat Cheung, Tsung-Wei Lin, and Kuang Hsuan Lee. The goal of this project was to analyze the current streaming market landscape and provide recommendations on what types of TV shows production studios should focus on creating next.

## Project Background
The project aims to address the following key questions:

What type of content is sought after by streaming platforms?
What type of content is not currently being offered, and where is there a potential gap?
Which TV shows are successful in the streaming space?
Using various datasets, we analyzed the market to uncover trends, gaps, and successful content strategies.

## Datasets
The analysis is based on the following datasets:

Reel Good Data (Scraped from website â€“ 2020): This dataset includes a wide range of information about TV shows available on top streaming platforms.
Ampere Analytics Tracked Content: Provides additional context on the content available on Netflix, Prime, and Hulu.
Nielsen Linear TV Ratings Data: Offers insights into traditional TV viewership, which complements the streaming data.

## Methodology
Our approach involved the following steps:

Existing Content Analysis: We examined the types of content currently available on the top 20 streaming platforms, identifying popular genres and tags.
Market Gap Analysis: Using k-means clustering, we identified genre combinations that are highly rated but not prevalent in the market, highlighting potential opportunities.
Successful TV Show Analysis: We defined success criteria for TV shows (high ratings, longevity, and availability on major platforms) and analyzed top shows to understand common traits.
Key Findings
Popular Genres: The most frequent genres across platforms are Drama, Comedy, Animation, Action & Adventure, and Documentary.
Popular Tags: Common tags include Adaptation, Supernatural, Based on Books, Police, and Teen.
Market Trends: There is a growing presence of TV shows from Asian production studios, while the dominance of North American and European shows is declining.
Potential Markets: High-potential genre combinations include Action & Adventure with Biography and Drama, Drama with LGBTQ themes, and Comedy with Drama and Horror.
Successful Shows: Successful TV shows tend to have high audience ratings, longevity (multiple seasons), and availability on major platforms.
Recommendations
Based on our findings, we recommend that production studios focus on creating content in the identified high-potential genres. Although these genres come with higher risk due to limited market presence, they also offer significant growth opportunities.
